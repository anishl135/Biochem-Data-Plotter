# Biochemistry Data Plotter

This Python application is designed to help you visualize and analyze your biochemistry data by creating plots. You can input your data points and specify the parameters for the X and Y axes. The application will then generate a plot for your data.

## Installation

Before running the application, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash 

    pip install tkinter matplotlib numpy scipy

## Usage
1. Run the application by executing the following command in your terminal:

        python biochemistry_app.py

2. The application window will appear.

3. Enter the number of data points you have in your dataset. Click "Enter Data Points."

4. Enter the parameters you want to use for the X and Y axes (e.g., "Substrate Concentration" and "Rate of Reaction").

5. For each data point, enter the corresponding X and Y values.

6. Click "Plot Graph" to generate the data plot. The plot will appear in a new window.

7. You can interact with the plot, zoom in, and save it if needed.

## Example
Suppose you have a dataset of enzyme kinetics with substrate concentrations and corresponding reaction rates. You can use this application to plot the data and visualize the relationship between substrate concentration and the rate of reaction.
